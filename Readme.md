This is a remix of the ARM 2.0 Terminal by Jay Doscher from doscher.com (https://www.doscher.com/arm-terminal-2-the-cube/)
I've slimmed it down a little to my preferred proportions and added extra access for up to two 2.5 inch drives,
although I don't recommend using more than one with the raspberry 5.
The amount of holders is decereased to 2 for this version, I find it sufficient, although there are still holes for a third if you wish to design and add an extra one.
I've also expanded the hole size for the required 34 M2.5x14 screws, you can use screws that are slightly shorter as well if you can't find
that specific size locally.
You will also find some assembly instructions, these might also help if you're building the original Cube terminal.
All parts can be printed without supports.
